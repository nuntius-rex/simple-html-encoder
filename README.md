# simple-html-encoder
A simple HTML encoder utility written in PHP.

I first wrote a version of this when working as a web analyst to aid me in documenting code.

More recently, I needed it during some of my tutorials to encode examples for ReactJS.

I hope it is of some help to you.

WARNING: This is just a quick tool to get a job done.
This type of code would be dangerous on a live server if used improperly.

Enjoy!
